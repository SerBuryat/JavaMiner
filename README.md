## Game Rules
You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain mines (bombs), others don't. 
If you click on a square containing a bomb, you lose. 
If you manage to click all the squares (without clicking on any bombs) you win.
Clicking a square which doesn't have a bomb reveals the number of neighbouring squares containing bombs.
